## Installation

1. Drop `border-quest-mod-x.x.x.jar` into your server's `mods/` folder alongside Fabric API.
2. Start the server once — `config/borderquest.json` is generated automatically.
3. Edit the config to suit your server, then run `/bq reload`.

---

## Commands

All commands start with `/bq` (alias available via any registered alias).

### Player commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/bq` or `/bq status` | Show current stage, objective and progress |
| `/bq submit` | Donate all eligible items from your inventory |
| `/bq ladder` | Show the top 10 donors |

### Operator commands (permission level 2)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/bq setaltar` | Register the block you are looking at as an altar |
| `/bq setaltar <name>` | Same, but assigns a display name (shown on maps) |
| `/bq removealtar` | Remove the looked-at block from the altar list |
| `/bq skip` | Force-advance to the next stage without filling the objective |
| `/bq reset` | Reset the game to stage 1 |
| `/bq reload` | Reload `borderquest.json` and the saved state without restarting |

> To **donate**, right-click any altar block while holding items.
> `/bq submit` works from anywhere and scans your entire inventory.

### Stage anatomy

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `borderRadius` | double | Half the side length of the square border (diameter = radius × 2) |
| `title` | string | Displayed in chat and the tab-list sidebar |
| `requirements` | list | Specific items required — `itemId` + `count` |
| `categoryRequirements` | list | Biome-adaptive requirements — `category` + `count` |
| `unlockRecipes` | list | Item IDs whose crafting recipes become unlocked at this stage (see Recipe locking) |
| `rewards` | list | Rewards given to all online players on stage validation |

**Built-in categories**: `logs`, `planks`, `wool`, `sand`, `stone` — resolved to the most common variants found in the spawn biome.

### Reward types

| `type` | Required fields | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `"item"` | `itemId`, `count` | `{ "type": "item", "itemId": "minecraft:diamond", "count": 2 }` |
| `"effect"` | `effectId`, `duration` (ticks), `amplifier` (0 = level I) | `{ "type": "effect", "effectId": "minecraft:speed", "duration": 400, "amplifier": 1 }` |
| `"xp"` | `amount` | `{ "type": "xp", "amount": 100 }` |

## Altar setup

Altars can be **any block** — a beacon, a chest, a custom banner — whatever fits your server's theme.

1. Place the block in-world.
2. Look at it and run `/bq setaltar` (optionally `/bq setaltar Altar du Spawn`).
3. Players can now right-click the block to donate items.

To remove an altar: look at it and run `/bq removealtar`.

> Altar positions are saved in `world/data/borderquest_state.json` and survive restarts.

---

## Map integrations

### BlueMap

Requires **BlueMap** installed on the server.
The mod automatically renders:
- A **green rectangle** showing the current border extent on the overworld map.
- A **POI marker** for each altar (with its display name if set).

Markers rebuild automatically when BlueMap reloads.

### Dynmap

Requires **Dynmap for Fabric** installed on the server.
Same markers as BlueMap — rendered via reflection, no extra dependency needed.

### JourneyMap & Xaero's Minimap / World Map

> **Singleplayer & LAN only.** These mods run client-side and are not available on a dedicated server's classpath.

When running in **singleplayer or LAN**, if JourneyMap, Xaero's Minimap, or Xaero's World Map is installed:
- A **waypoint** is created for each altar when it is registered.
- The waypoint is removed when the altar is removed.
- Border shapes are not supported (client-side map limitation).

The integration uses reflection — no additional configuration is needed.

---

## Discord webhook

1. Create a webhook in your Discord server: **Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**.
2. Copy the URL and paste it in `borderquest.json`:
   ```json
   "discordEnabled": true,
   "discordWebhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789/abc...",
   "discordUsername": "Border Quest",
   "discordAvatarUrl": ""
   ```
3. Run `/bq reload`.

A message is sent automatically each time a stage is completed.

---

## Dimension locks

By default:
- **The Nether** is locked until stage 5.
- **The End** is locked until stage 7.

Attempting to enter a locked dimension cancels the teleport and displays a red message.
Customise or remove locks in `borderquest.json` under `worldLocks`.

---

## Recipe locking

Lock certain item recipes behind stages. When a recipe is locked, the crafting result slot stays empty (crafting table, player inventory 2x2, furnace) and the recipe book auto-craft is blocked.

> **Server-side limitation.** Since this mod runs only on the server, locked recipes may still appear in the client's recipe book — but they cannot be crafted.

Add `unlockRecipes` inside a stage definition:

```jsonc
{
  "borderRadius": 25,
  "title": "Iron Age",
  "requirements": [{ "itemId": "minecraft:iron_ingot", "count": 32 }],
  "unlockRecipes": [
    "minecraft:iron_pickaxe",
    "minecraft:iron_axe",
    "minecraft:iron_sword",
    "minecraft:shield"
  ],
  "rewards": []
}
```

Recipes are **cumulative**: at stage N, all recipes from stages 0 through N are unlocked.
Items **not listed** in any `unlockRecipes` are always craftable (backward compatible).

---

## Saved state

The game state (current stage, submitted items, altar list, donor stats) is saved in:

```
<world>/data/borderquest_state.json
```

Back up this file if you want to preserve progress between map resets.

---

## Building from source

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd border-quest-mod
# macOS / Linux :
java -jar gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar build
# Windows :
gradlew build
# Output: build/libs/border-quest-<mcversion>-<version>.jar
```

**Requirements:** Java 21, internet access (to download Fabric Loom and BlueMap API).

Override the mod version for testing:
```bash
java -jar gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar build -Pmod_version=1.1.0
```

This project uses **separate branches per Minecraft version**:
- `develop` — main development branch (no releases)
- `1.21.11` — stable releases for Minecraft 1.21.11
- `1.22`, etc. — future Minecraft version support

Releases are triggered by **git tags** on a version branch:
```bash
git checkout 1.21.11
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

This builds, creates a GitHub Release, and publishes to Modrinth automatically.

Dependencies at a glance:

| Artifact | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `net.fabricmc.fabric-api` | `modImplementation` | Fabric API |
| `de.bluecolored:bluemap-api:2.7.7` | `compileOnly` | BlueMap markers at compile time |
| Dynmap, JourneyMap, Xaero's | none | Integrated via reflection — no compile dependency |
